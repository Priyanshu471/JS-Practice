# JavaScript Interview Practice

Welcome to the JavaScript Interview Practice repository! This place is all about getting better at JavaScript, even if you're just starting out. Let's dive into some cool topics!

## Topics Covered

### Event Bubbling

Event Bubbling is like passing a message in a room full of people. Imagine you clap your hands, and everyone in the room hears it, not just the person closest to you. That's event bubbling! For more examples, check out [Practice.js](Practice.js#event-bubbling).

### Event Capturing

Event Capturing is the opposite of event bubbling. Instead of starting with the person closest to you, it starts with someone far away and moves closer. Think of it like a whisper that travels through the room. Learn more in [Practice.js](Practice.js#event-capturing).

### Event Delegation

Event Delegation is like having one person in charge of listening to everyone's claps in the room. It's super efficient when you have lots of people. Check out [Practice.js](Practice.js#event-delegation) for examples!

### Function Currying

Function Currying is a way of breaking down a task into smaller steps. Imagine you're making a sandwich. You first make the bread, then add cheese, and then some veggies. That's function currying! Dive deeper in [Practice.js](Practice.js#function-currying).

### Call, Apply, and Bind Methods

These methods help you share your superpowers (functions) with others (objects). Think of it like lending your car (function) to a friend (object) for a ride. Discover more in [Practice.js](Practice.js#call-apply-and-bind-methods).

### Map, Filter, and Reduce

Map, Filter, and Reduce are like superhero tools for working with lists of things. 

- **Map** transforms each item in a list into something else, like turning a list of numbers into a list of their squares.
- **Filter** lets you pick only the items you want from a list, like selecting only the ripest fruits from a basket.
- **Reduce** combines all the items in a list into a single result, like adding up all the scores in a game.

Check out [Practice.js](Practice.js#map-filter-and-reduce) for examples!

### Polyfills

Polyfills are like magic spells for old devices. They make sure your cool new JavaScript tricks work on older gadgets. Find out why they're awesome in [Practice.js](Practice.js#what-are-polyfills-and-why-use-them).

### Output-Based Questions

To test your skills, try answering these questions:

1. Return an array containing car names in uppercase.
2. Return only details of cars whose price is more than 70 Lakhs.
3. Return the total price of all cars.
4. Return only the name of cars whose price is more than 80 Lakhs.
5. Return the total price for cars with prices more than 80 Lakhs after adding 20 Lakhs to those with prices less than 80 Lakhs.

Have fun learning JavaScript! ðŸš€
